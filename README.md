# leadscrew
FreeCAD adjustable multi-start lead screw model
## Why?
Because every other design I found was not available in source form, or easily adjustable.
## Caveat
This is only a model, and doesn't represent something you would actually machine. I use it so that I can have a part in my CAD designs that is close enough to visually represent what the part is.
